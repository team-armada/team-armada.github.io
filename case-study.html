          <h2 class="h2">1. Introduction</h2>
          <br />
          <h3>1.1. What is Armada?</h3>
          <p>
            Armada is an open-source container orchestration tool that allows
            administrators to automate the configuration and deployment of
            development environments in the cloud.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Each development environment within Armada exists as a set of
            containers that exposes an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
            and all its necessary dependencies to developers via their browsers.
            Armada's architecture is self-hosted on an administrator's Amazon
            Web Services (AWS) account and is entirely managed from a dashboard
            in the browser.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>1.2 Understanding the Problem Space</h3>
          <p>
            Before diving into Armada's feature set, it's important to highlight
            the difficulties of setting up and maintaining developer
            environments. Common challenges include configuration, dependency
            management, and resource availability.
          </p>

            />
            <figcaption>Fig. 1: Problem Space.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <br />

          <h4>1.2.1 Configuration Overload</h4>

          <p>
            Developers have no shortage of productivity-enhancing tools from
            bundlers to compilers to linters to transpilers. These tools support
            a diverse set of use cases across an ever-expanding number of
            disciplines, often exposing a configuration file for users to
            fine-tune settings.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            While the flexibility of customizing a tool to address individual
            use cases may seem like an ideal solution, repeating this process
            across multiple tools can lead to a constellation of fragile
            dependencies and lengthen the amount of time that it takes to get
            started on a project. Furthermore, some tools offer so much
            flexibility that their configuration files can require their own
            specialists to decipher, all of which can easily lead to decision
            fatigue. Rather than outlining your core feature set, you'll spend a
            non-trivial amount of time level-setting your linter and fiddling
            with your formatter.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>1.2.2 Dependency Management</h4>
          <p>
            Most applications rely on other publically-available tools,
            frameworks, and libraries. Reusing the work of others removes
            redundancy from workflows and greatly accelerates the speed with
            which software can be developed. However, using these tools comes
            with its own set of tradeoffs.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Almost all modern software is constructed in this way, which means
            that any project that an engineer might work on will have to contend
            not only with its immediate dependencies but also the dependencies
            that its dependencies introduce. While package management tools
            abstract much of this complexity away, developers are still left to
            deal with the fragility that arises from long chains of
            dependencies: upgrading a single dependency can break the entire
            chain or create a circular dependency.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>1.2.3 Resource Availability</h4>

          <p>
            Depending on the environment you're working in or the type of
            application you're attempting to construct, your workflow may
            require a significant amount of computational resources (i.e., CPU,
            RAM, GPU, etc.).
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>Such tasks include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Creating virtual environments on your local machine (i.e., VMWare,
              Docker, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>Utilizing compilers and test runners in "watch" mode.</li>
            <li>
              Running emulation software for specific deployment targets (i.e.,
              Android, iOS,watchOS, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>Compiling complex or large applications.</li>
            <li>Running one or more databases.</li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <p>
            These computationally-intensive tasks increase the minimum hardware
            requirements needed to be able to do certain kinds of development
            work. Unfortunately, this hardware can be expensive, limiting access
            to the machines that can perform these tasks.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>1.3 Narrowing Our Focus: Education</h3>

          <p>
            Although these issues are commonplace, they're often most keenly
            felt by students just getting started, which means they're
            particularly challenging for their instructors as well.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>1.3.1 Students</h4>

          <p>
            For students who are just learning how to build software, the
            challenges of setting up a development environment can be
            frustrating at best and insurmountable at worst. A new student's
            time and effort are better spent on gaining fluency and comfort with
            core programming skills, such as being able to write valid code,
            understand syntax, efficiently parse error messages, work on the
            command line, and read documentation. Furthermore, time and
            attention are both finite, and students who have exhausted their
            mental resources in the setup phase of a lesson are less likely to
            complete the lesson itself.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>1.3.2 Instructors</h4>

          <p>
            From the perspective of those teaching software development,
            understanding precisely why a student's development environment
            isn't working correctly can be a time-consuming guessing game, and
            navigating version conflicts and configuration issues on a
            student-by-student basis is neither efficient nor scalable.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2 class="h2">2. Supporting Students</h2>
          <br />

          <h3>2.1 One-by-One</h3>

          <p>
            In a typical classroom setting, each student's development
            environment is their local machine. When issues with dependencies or
            configuration arise, the instructor needs to troubleshoot them on
            the individual machines where they're appearing. In the best case,
            an issue may be so common that the instructor can document how to
            resolve the problem and leave said resolution to students. An
            alternative is that the instructor can manually intervene to prevent
            the issue from arising again. In any event, dealing with the
            recurring issues of configuration and dependency management across
            many individual machines is burdensome.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>2.2 One for All, All for One</h3>

          <p>
            What if an instructor were able to guarantee that every student had
            access to the same hardware and software? Dealing with a single
            configuration would significantly reduce the complexity of
            supporting a group of students. But, how could this be done?
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Rather than purchasing a new computer for every student, an
            instructor might consider <strong>virtualization</strong>:
            configuring multiple, isolated environments for students all from
            one server.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>2.2.1 Virtualization</h4>

          <p>
            According to
            <strong
              ><a
                href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/virtualization-a-complete-guide"
                >International Business Machines (IBM)</a
              ></strong
            >, "Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over
            computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single
            computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into
            multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs).
            Each VM runs its own operating system and behaves like an
            independent computer, even though it is running on just a portion of
            the actual underlying computer hardware." In some instances, the
            computer running the virtualized environments is referred to as the
            <strong>host</strong> or <strong>host machine</strong>, while the
            virtualized environments themselves are referred to as guests or
            guest operating systems.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>2.2.2 The Upside</h4>

          <p>
            One of the key features of virtualization is the ability to create
            an <strong>image</strong>, a snapshot of a computer's operating
            system, its files, and its overall state. After an image is created,
            it can serve as the basis for an arbitrary number of virtual
            machines. For instance, an image could contain all of the
            prerequisite files, software, and dependencies needed to perform
            tasks for a given class. These images could also be used to restore
            a given virtual machine to the desired state should something go
            awry.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            With this approach, an instructor could configure a single,
            functional workspace to distribute to each student. If changes or
            updates need to be made, the instructor could simply create a new
            image, ensuring that solving a configuration problem for a single
            student would solve the same configuration problem for all students.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>2.2.2 The Downside</h4>

          <p>
            The prospective overhead in terms of time and money is significant.
            The kinds of servers capable of hosting enough VMs for a classroom
            of students are not cheap, and managing them becomes a job in and of
            itself. Additionally, this is not a scalable solution: adding
            capacity means upgrading existing hardware or purchasing new
            hardware altogether. The server is also a single point of failure.
            If it goes down, no student can access their environment.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>2.3 The Cloud A Possible Solution</h3>

          <p>
            An ideal solution would abstract away the problems of hardware
            without being cost-prohibitive while ensuring that issues resolved
            for one student would be resolved for all students. Fortunately,
            modern cloud technologies make such a solution possible. By offering
            centrally-managed, virtualized environments to students from the
            cloud, it's possible to affordably offer a set of virtual machines
            that can be configured and maintained from a single template and
            served to an arbitrary number of students.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2 class="h2">3. Cloud Deployments</h2>

          <br />

          <h3>3.1 What are Cloud Environments?</h3>

          <p>
            Cloud environments are a type of third-party service that provides
            on-demand access to networking and computational resources. Unlike
            on-premises data centers, which require purchasing and configuring
            new hardware to expand capacity, cloud environments can easily scale
            with demand. To add capacity in a cloud environment, users simply
            need to make a request to the cloud provider. In many cases, the
            provisioning of capacity can be managed automatically to adjust the
            number of resources according to the user's needs.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>3.2 A Modular, Replicable Approach</h3>

          <p>
            In a cloud environment, instructors no longer have to concern
            themselves with hardware. They can dedicate their time and attention
            to configuring a single environment exactly as they want it before
            deploying it as many times as they need.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>3.3 A Identifying Inefficiencies</h3>

          <p>
            This solution has a significant drawback, however, because the
            minimum memory and CPU capacity for VMs offered by cloud providers
            is still well beyond what most development environments require.
            Most of the time students won't use the full capacity of either the
            machine's CPU or its memory, which means that instructors are paying
            for more resources than they're actually using. For this reason,
            many developers opt to further virtualize their environments with
            the help of <strong>containers</strong>.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>3.4 Containerization</h3>

          <p>
            Containers use virtualization but are not fully-fledged virtual
            machines on their own. Instead, containers are applications that are
            bundled along with their dependencies using software such as Docker.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Rather than virtualizing an entire machine including its hardware
            like a VM, containers instead virtualize the OS, allowing them to
            stay much lighter-weight than VMs & unaware of the underlying
            systems they are running on.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            One side effect of this lighter-weight is that containers aren't
            meant to persist for long periods of time. Instead, they're designed
            to be created, used, and then destroyed. Due to their ephemeral
            nature, containers often present unique challenges when attempting
            to persist data.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>3.4.1 An Aside: Docker</h4>

          <p>
            Docker is an open-source platform for creating, developing, and
            managing containers. Within the Docker ecosystem, container images
            are created via a <strong>Dockerfile</strong>. Dockerfiles enable
            developers to configure how a container is constructed, including
            specifying a base image that can be extended. These images are
            consumed by the Docker Engine which is a runtime environment that
            enables containers to be run locally on a developer's machine.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>3.5 The Challenges of Managing the Cloud</h3>

          <p>
            In order for an instructor to take advantage of containerization in
            the cloud to create and replicate developer environments, they would
            need to do the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Choose a cloud provider.</li>
            <li>
              Learn about the different services available through that provider
              or identify an abstracted solution that works across cloud
              providers (i.e., Hashicorp's Terraform).
            </li>
            <li>
              Provision and connect the various services needed to create
              containerized environments and make them accessible to students.
            </li>
            <li>
              Manage security and permissions to ensure that students (and only
              students) have access to what they need.
            </li>
            <li>
              Develop a scalable process to create and destroy these
              environments.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <p>
            Performing each of these steps requires a significant amount of
            expertise, time, and effort. Fortunately, there are several
            commercially-available products that achieve these goals without
            requiring the instructor to be a cloud expert.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2 class="h2">4. Existing Solutions</h2>

          <p>
            There are a handful of products that abstract away the issues of
            creating and managing developer environments at scale within the
            cloud. These are Coder, Gitpod, and GitHub Codespaces.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h3>4.1 Clarifying Criteria</h3>

          <p>
            While each of these individual solutions have their own particular
            strengths, they also come with their own set of tradeoffs. We
            assessed these solutions against several key criteria:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Ease of Setup</strong>: How difficult is it to get a
              working copy of this product on your own system?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ease of Use</strong>: How difficult is it to configure and
              use the features offered by this product?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Multi-IDE Support</strong>: Does this product let you
              choose which IDE to use (i.e., VS Code, JetBrains, etc.)?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Custom Templates</strong>: Does this product provide the
              ability to customize the environment and its dependencies to meet
              my needs?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Self-Hostable</strong>: Could you deploy this product on
              an architecture of your own?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost</strong>: What are the upfront and recurring costs
              for a given solution? Do I have to pay a flat price, a price per
              user, or is there a tiered system involved?
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <h3>4.2 Tangible Tradeoffs</h3>

          <br />

          <h4>4.2.1 Coder</h4>
          <p>
            Coder is light, fast, flexible, and offers all of the core
            functionality a developer expects in an IDE. However, getting it up
            and running on your own system can be challenging. Whether you're
            using their self-hosted platform or their enterprise product,
            there's a fair number of obstacles that require manual intervention
            creating a higher barrier of entry. That being said, Coder provides
            a reasonably priced platform which charges $35 per user per month.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>4.2.2 Gitpod</h4>
          <p>
            Gitpod offers an extensive feature set, and aside from a longer
            startup time, it's also quite fast and flexible. Like Coder, the
            installation process doesn't always work right out of the box, and
            it can be challenging to get a working copy of the free-tier product
            on a local machine. The full range of features offered by Gitpod can
            make it challenging to configure, making the learning curve rather
            steep for all of the bells and whistles that it provides.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>4.2.3 GitHub Codespaces</h4>
          <p>
            Due to its seamless integration with the GitHub platform, GitHub
            Codespaces offers an easy-to-use, turnkey experience that allows
            developers to get started quickly. However, GitHub Codespaces limits
            users to operating only on their platform through the use of an
            instance of VS Code. Additionally, the environments provided by
            GitHub Codespaces can be customized to meet individual needs, but
            the cost of each environment is the most out of any of the available
            solutions.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Each of these products stand on their own merit, but it became clear
            that there was one thing they all had in common: all three were
            designed with a seasoned developer in mind as their end user, and
            were largely built to accommodate the needs of enterprises.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>That's where <strong>Armada</strong> comes in…</p>

          <br />

          <h3>4.3 An Education-First Approach</h3>

          <p>
            We built Armada to provide an easy-to-use, low-cost option that was
            tailor-made for the education space.
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>
            Some key features which differentiate Armada from existing solutions
            include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Target Audience</strong>: Armada was built with education
              in mind and aimed to be powerful enough to serve a broad
              cross-section of instructors and students without being
              technically burdensome.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ease of Use</strong>: Administrators can easily create and
              manage development environments from Armada's UI. After
              authenticating, all students need is a link to their environment
              to access it via their browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cost</strong>: Armada's only cost is the cost incurred
              from running its underlying resources on the cloud.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>System Ownership</strong>: Armada is deployed to an
              instructor's own AWS account, allowing them to maintain full
              control over the system and the data it generates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Extensibility</strong>: Armada is fully open-source. Any
              sufficiently technical instructor is free to extend the system to
              suit their particular needs.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

            and paid offerings.

          <h3>5.1 Recap</h3>

          <br />

          <h4>5.2.1 Challenges</h4>

          <p>
            Configuring a development environment presents several challenges,
            which include:
          </p>

          <br />

          <h5>For Students</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Knowledge of complicated environment configuration and dependency
              management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Access to hardware capable of carrying out common developer tasks
              and running supporting software.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <h5>For Instructors</h5>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Navigating between a compounding number of student hardware
              configurations, operating systems, software versions, and
              experience levels.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <h4>5.2.2 Goals</h4>

          <p>
            In response to these challenges, we developed Armada with the
            following goals in mind:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Create easy-to-use development environments for students.</li>
            <li>
              Make it easy for instructors to manage and deploy development
              environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide the ability to scale to meet student and instructor
              demand.
            </li>
            <li>Minimize costs for instructors.</li>
          </ol>

          <br />

          <h3>5.2 But First, A Demo</h3>

          <br />

          <h3>5.3 The Roadmap</h3>

          <p>
            With this information in hand, there were eight key milestones that
            we needed to achieve in order to create, manage, and serve
            development environments that instructors and students could make
            use of, including:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>Containerizing a workspace.</li>
            <li>Provisioning cloud infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Deploying a single workspace.</li>
            <li>Deploying several workspaces.</li>
            <li>Accessing workspaces from dedicated URLs.</li>
            <li>Persisting workspace data.</li>
            <li>
              Establishing relationships between user data entities and
              providing a user interface for instructors and students.
            </li>
            <li>Providing user authentication.</li>
          </ol>

          <br />

          <h2 class="h2">6. Future work</h2>
          <p>
            In the future, we would like Armada to have extended features that
            allow instructors to specify custom development environments for
            their courses using their own Docker images. This would allow for
            the ultimate flexibility in creating workspaces that are catered to
            an exact course or situation. Other avenues for improvement include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Creating a one-click deployment for AWS via CloudFormation to make
              generating the infrastructure easier.
            </li>
            <li>
              Creating a one-click deployment for AWS via CloudFormation to make
              generating the infrastructure easier.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrating with GitHub repositories to allow the data from the
              repository to be automatically inserted into the generated
              workspaces.
            </li>
            <li>
              Integrating existing solutions either via VS Code Live Share or
              paid extensions that allow users to work collaboratively within a
              single environment.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementing cost-saving measures such as spinning down ECS
              Services when the containers are not in use.
            </li>
          </ul>
